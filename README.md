## Hyper parameters

Parameters which define the model architecture are referred to as Hyper-parameters and thus this process of searching for the ideal model architecture is referred to as Hyperparameter Tuning.

Two types of parameters exist in machine learning models: one that can be initialized and updated through the data learning process (e.g. the weights of neurons in neural networks, number of epochs, activation function), named Model-parameters; while other named Hyper-parameters, cannot be directly estimated from data learning and must be set before training a Machine learning model because they define the architecture of a machine learning model.

To fit a machine learning model into different problems, its hyper-parameters must be tuned. Selecting the best hyper-parameter configuration for machine learning models has a direct impact on the modelâ€™s performance i.e on accuracy and efficiency while training the model. Therefore it needed to be set accurately to get better and efficient results.
